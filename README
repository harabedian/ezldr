Release Notes
ezldr v0.1.0
August 31,2016
==============

Ezldr is a command line utility for quickly and easily loading data 
into an Oracle database.  The intention in creating ezldr was to make loading
data from a delimted file into Oracle as simple as possible.   

It is not required for there to be an already existing table to load data into.
Ezldr will create the table for you based on the definition in the data file
being loaded into the database.  While ezldr will create the table if
necessary, you may also pre-create the target table. 


Using ezldr
-----------
Loading data can be as simple as providing database connection information
and the name of the source data file to load.  For example,

	ezdlr myusername/mypwd data.csv

This will result in a table named "EZLDR_DATA" being created in the
"myusername" schema.
